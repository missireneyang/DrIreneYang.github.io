**The PI: Dr. Irene Yang**
I have dedicated my career to pursuing a deeper understanding of the human body, particularly the musculoskeletal system. As an engineer, the human body is the most natural, complex, creative and the most interesting machine that we remains a big mystery to us despite how well studied it is. My curiosity drives my passion to learn more, use the tools we have with rigour and to engineer the tools that don't exist to enable us to learn more about our bones, and fix them when they're broken.

I lead the Western Engineering for Spine and Trauma (WEST) lab (Victoria Hospital, London, Ontario, Canada) as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering (MME), Faculty of Engineering and the Department of Surgery, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry at University of Western Ontario (UWO). I also hold the position of Endowed Chair in Spine and Trauma Biomechanics. 

I read a DPhil from The University of Oxford, completed my Postdoctoral Research training in the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Engineering Collaborative, before obtaining my independent academic fellowship at The University of Edinburgh focused on developing monitoring tools for bone fracture healing. I am a co-inventor of a novel orthopaedic technology (bone implant) for children sufferring from coronal plane angular deformities of the lower limb e.g. genu varum & genu valgum, and a wrist arthrodesis implant for fixed flexion deformity in Cerebral Palsy patients (The University of Sydney, Australia). I have also worked on improving existing orthopaedic technology, including the [Oxford Knee implant](https://www.zimmerbiomet.com/en/products-and-solutions/specialties/knee/oxford-partial-knee.html) (Oxford University, UK), and developing ultrasonic bone cutting tools (University of Edinburgh, Scotland). I have also travelled to orthopaedic research labs across the US (University of Denver, Colorado Joint Replacement, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Hospital for Special Surgery (NY), Northeastern University in Boston) and in Canada (University of Ottawa) as a BORS/BJR travelling fellow.

Having studied and worked around the world, I endeavour to support trainees in my lab to dream big, work hard and achieve great engineering feats in orthopedic surgery. Big dreams are achievable, they just require the insight to break them into solvable and achievable tasks, determination, hard work, persistence and a great supportive team.  Students working in my lab will gain in-depth knowledge about bone tissue, invaluable sound technical engineering skills including 3D computer-aided design (CAD) modelling, integrated real-time position tracking, 3D prototyping (3D printing), finite element analysis (FEA) and Python coding. Trainees will also gain exposure to a patient care environment, learn how to work in a team and develop invaluable strong personal, interdisciplinary communication skills (oral & written) by interacting closely with orthopedic surgeons, academic peers and scientists.

**WEST Lab**
WEST Lab is located at Victoria Hospital, in London, Ontario, Canada. Our research focuses on orthopaedic biomechanics and load transfer through bones, particularly in broken bones. Clinically, broken bones are called "fractures". We study bone as a material, bone fractures, and bone healing after injury. Embedded within Victoria Hospital, our team works very closely with the 100 trauma and spine surgeons from the [Department of Orthopedic Surgery](https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/surgery//divisions/orthopaedic_surgery.html) at the Schulich School of Dentistry and Medicine at the UWO, using engineering methods and tools to study bone biomechanics. We currently have multiple ongoing research projects focused on measuring bone healing, and on developing new surgical implants to improve healing of fractured bones. Our central goal as a research group is to improve our understanding of bones after fracture, and to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment and improve patient fracture care. We are always interested in building our research profile so please reach out if you have an idea of your own that you are looking to investigate.

**INTERESTED IN JOINING OUR RESEARCH TEAM?**
We are currently recruiting the bright, passionate, knowledgeable and hard-working researchers from across [Engineering](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/graduate/future-students/Graduate-Degree-Programs/index.html) or [Medicine](https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/gradstudies//future_students/programs/index.html). Please reach out if you have skills or would like to expand your skills in: robot operating systems (ROS), Python coding, machine learning (tensorflow), finite element analysis (FEA), SolidWorks or mechanical bench testing, review writing, clinical trials, clinical validation testing. 

Email irene.yang@uwo.ca, attach your latest CV and a cover letter explaining your research interests, your skills, whether you have/require funding, and which degree you are interested in pursuing (incl. domestic or international status).
