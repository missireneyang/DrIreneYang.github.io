I am an an Assistant Professor in the Department of Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering (MME), Faculty of Engineering at University of Western Ontario (UWO). I also hold the position of Endowed Chair in Spine and Trauma Biomechanics. My lab, the Western Engineering for Spine and Trauma (WEST) lab is located at Victoria Hospital, in London, Ontario, Canada. I work with trauma and spine surgeons from the [Department of Orthopedic Surgery](https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/surgery//divisions/orthopaedic_surgery.html) at the Schulich School of Dentistry and Medicine at the UWO.

I am interested in biomechanics and load transfer through bones, particularly in broken bones. Clinically, broken bones are called "fractures". I study bone as a material, bone fractures, and bone healing after injury. My research work is aimed at using or developing engineering methods and tools to measure bone healing (capacity and amount), and to develop new surgical implants to improve healing of fractured bones.

This tools will improve our understanding of how bones heal after fracture, improve clinical diagnosis and treatment and improve patient fracture care.

Students working in my lab will gain in-depth knowledge about bone tissue, invaluable sound technical engineering skills including 3D computer-aided design (CAD) modelling, integrated real-time position tracking, 3D prototyping (3D printing), finite element analysis (FEA) and Python coding. Trainees will also gain exposure to a patient care environment, learn how to work in a team and develop invaluable strong personal, interdisciplinary communication skills (oral & written) by interacting closely with orthopedic surgeons, academic peers and scientists.

I hold a DPhil from The University of Oxford. I completed my Postdoctoral Research training in the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Engineering Collaborative, before obtaining my independent academic fellowship at The University of Edinburgh. I am a co-inventor of a novel orthopaedic technology (bone implant) for children sufferring from coronal plane angular deformities of the lower limb e.g. genu varum & genu valgum, as well as a wrist arthrodesis implant for fixed flexion deformity in Cerebral Palsy patients (The University of Sydney, Australia). I have also worked on improving existing orthopaedic technology, including the [Oxford Knee implant](https://www.zimmerbiomet.com/en/products-and-solutions/specialties/knee/oxford-partial-knee.html) (Oxford University, UK), and developing ultrasonic bone cutting tools (University of Edinburgh, Scotland).

I am a former BORS/BJR travelling fellowship, which allowed me to tour orthopaedic research labs across the US (University of Denver, Colorado Joint Replacement, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Hospital for Special Surgery (NY), Northeastern University in Boston and University of Ottawa in Canada).
