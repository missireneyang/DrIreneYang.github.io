I am interested in using engineering approaches to either gain more understanding about an orthopaedic condition or to develop novel engineering solutions to diagnose or treat orthopaedic musculoskeletal conditions. I am a co-inventor of a novel orthopaedic technology (bone implant) for children sufferring from coronal plane angular deformities of the lower limb e.g. genu varum & genu valgum, as well as a wrist arthrodesis implant for fixed flexion deformity. This work was carried out with [Professor David G. Little](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Little-9) (Sydney, Australia). I have also worked on improving existing orthopaedic technology, including the [Oxford Knee implant](https://www.zimmerbiomet.com/en/products-and-solutions/specialties/knee/oxford-partial-knee.html).

I hold a DPhil from The University of Oxford where I was supervised by [Professor David W. Murray](https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/david-murray) and [Professor Stephen J. Mellon](https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/stephen-mellon). I completed my Postdoctoral Research training in the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Engineering Collaborative under [Professor Hamish Simpson](https://www.ed.ac.uk/inflammation-research/people/principal-investigators/professor-hamish-simpson). I am a former BORS/BJR travelling fellowship, which allowed me to tour orthopaedic research labs across the US (University of Denver, Colorado Joint Replacement, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Hospital for Special Surgery (NY), Northeastern University in Boston and University of Ottawa in Canada). Currently, I am an academic research fellow with an Innovation Fellowship from the University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Innovations
