**The PI: Dr. Irene Yang**

As an engineer, I have always found the human body to be the most natural, complex, creative and the most interesting machine. There remains so much that we still do not understand, and as the body continues to evolve with time, there remains even more that we have to learn. My curiosity about the unknown drives my passion to learn. I strongly believe that with scientific rigour, and logic we can use the tools that exist or engineer the tools that don't exist to enable us to learn more about our bones, and fix them when they are not functioning as intended.

I lead the Western Engineering for Spine and Trauma (WEST) Lab located at Victoria Hospital (London, Ontario, Canada) as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering (MME), Faculty of Engineering and the Department of Surgery, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry at University of Western Ontario (UWO). I also hold the position of Endowed Chair in Spine and Trauma Biomechanics. 

Originally from South Africa, I hold a Bachelor of Mechanical (Biomedical) Engineering and Bachelor of Medical Science from the University of Sydney (Australia). I read my DPhil at The University of Oxford (United Kingdom), completed my postdoctoral research training in the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Engineering Collaborative, before obtaining my independent academic fellowship at The University of Edinburgh (Scotland) focused on developing monitoring tools for bone fracture healing. I am a co-inventor of a novel orthopaedic technology (bone implant) for children sufferring from coronal plane angular deformities of the lower limb e.g. genu varum & genu valgum, and a wrist arthrodesis implant for fixed flexion deformity in Cerebral Palsy patients (University of Sydney; OrthoPediatrics Corp., Signature Orthopaedics). I have also worked on improving existing orthopaedic technology including the [Oxford Knee implant](https://www.zimmerbiomet.com/en/products-and-solutions/specialties/knee/oxford-partial-knee.html) (Oxford University, UK; Zimmer Biomet), and on developing ultrasonically powered bone cutting tools (University of Edinburgh, Scotland; Stryker). I have had the great privilege as a BORS/BJR travelling fellow to visit orthopaedic research labs across the US (University of Denver, Colorado Joint Replacement, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Hospital for Special Surgery (NY), Northeastern University in Boston) and in Canada (University of Ottawa) before establishing the WEST Lab as an Assistant Professor.

**WEST Lab**

WEST Lab is located at Victoria Hospital, in London, Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The city of London is the 11th largest city in Canada and home to a diverse population totalling just under half a million people with a rich medical research community. Western University has pioneered the seamless inter-disciplinary research between engineering and orthopedic surgery, with the establishment of numerous well-supported research labs, each with their own unique expertise snd research focus to tackle big research questions. See below for a map of the research labs surrounding WEST Lab at Western University:

We conduct orthopaedic biomechanics research to study the effects of load transfer through bones mostly in the lower limb and in the spine. One current major research theme of our group is broken bones. Clinically, broken bones are called "fractures". We study bone as a material, bone fractures, and bone healing after injury. Embedded within Victoria Hospital, our team works very closely with the 100 trauma and spine surgeons from the [Department of Orthopedic Surgery](https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/surgery//divisions/orthopaedic_surgery.html) at the Schulich School of Dentistry and Medicine at the UWO, using engineering methods and tools to study bone biomechanics. We are always interested in building our research profile so please reach out if you have a closely related research idea that you are looking to investigate.

Our team consists of dedicated, passionate, technically skilled engineers, orthopedic surgeons, and clinical and research staff working together as a team in a dynamic and supportive clinical research environment to tackle important musculoskeletal research questions. Our central goal as a research group is to improve our fundamental understanding of bones from an engineering perspective, using engineering tools, techniques and approaches to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal patients. We support our researchers to develop in-depth knowledge about bone tissue, invaluable sound technical engineering skills including 3D computer-aided design (CAD) modelling, integrated real-time position tracking, 3D prototyping (3D printing), finite element analysis (FEA) and Python coding. Trainees will also gain exposure to a patient care environment, learn how to interact closely with orthopedic surgeons, academic peers, industry partners and scientists and develop invaluable strong personal, interdisciplinary communication skills (oral & written) by publishing world class research articles and presenting their cutting-edge research work at national and international conferences and meetings.

WEST lab is equipped with an Instron 5967 â€“ Dual Column Table Frame material testing machine, ARAMIS adjustable 12M Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system, Clarius handheld ultrasound scanner and Formlab resin 3D printer. We are also fully equipped with basic engineering tools including drill press, bench grinder, band saw, mitre saw, metal lathe. The laboratory also has access to microCT, DEXA, pQCT, clinical imaging facilities, and pre-clinical surgical and imaging facilities. As we are based at Victoria Hospital, and work closely with the orthopedic surgeons, we are also able to run clinical validation, intra-operative testing and clinical trials.
