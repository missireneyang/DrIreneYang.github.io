I completed my DPhil at The University of Oxford and subsequently joined the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Engineering Collaborative as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Engineering. In 2023, I was awarded the BORS/BJR travelling fellowship, which allowed me to tour orthopaedic research labs across the US (University of Denver, Colorado Joint Replacement, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Hospital for Special Surgery (NY), Northeastern University in Boston and University of Ottawa in Canada) during February. After returning from the travelling fellowship, I was awarded an Innovation Academic Research Fellowship at the University of Edinburgh.
