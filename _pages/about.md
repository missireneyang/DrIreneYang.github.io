In my research work, I am interested in using engineering approaches to either understand orthopaedic conditions or to develop engineering solutions to diagnose or to treat orthopaedic musculoskeletal conditions. I have co-invented and developed novel orthopaedic technology (implants) for children sufferring from musculoskeletal disorders e.g. genu varum, genu valgum, fixed flexion deformity with [Professor David G. Little](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David-Little-9) (Sydney, Australia) and I have also worked on improving existing orthopaedic technology for adult sufferring from osteoarthritis.

I hold a DPhil from The University of Oxford where I was supervised by [Professor David W. Murray](https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/david-murray) and [Professor Stephen J. Mellon](https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/team/stephen-mellon). I completed my Postdoctoral Research training in the Edinburgh Orthopaedic Engineering Collaborative under [Professor Hamish Simpson](https://www.ed.ac.uk/inflammation-research/people/principal-investigators/professor-hamish-simpson). I am a former BORS/BJR travelling fellowship, which allowed me to tour orthopaedic research labs across the US (University of Denver, Colorado Joint Replacement, University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, Hospital for Special Surgery (NY), Northeastern University in Boston and University of Ottawa in Canada) during February. Currently, I am an academic research fellow with an Innovation Fellowship from the University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Innovations.
