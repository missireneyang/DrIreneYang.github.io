Abstract
Background: Bearing dislocation is a problem following mobile bearing Oxford lateral Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR). Therefore, the design of the tibial component was changed from a flat tibial surface to a domed tibial surface with a biconcave bearing to increase bearing entrapment. This systematic review compared the dislocation and revision rates of the two designs.

Methods: Two authors independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and ISI Web of Science, reference lists of retrieved articles, and the internet. Randomised, cohort, case-control and case studies of adult patients with lateral knee osteoarthritis treated with flat or domed Oxford lateral UKR and their outcomes were included. The overall dislocation rate and the annual revision rate (per 100 component years) were determined.

Results: Nine studies (937 knees) met the inclusion criteria (3 flat, 6 domed). Four studies (all domed) had a low risk of bias and five had a high risk (3 flat, 2 domed), so data should be interpreted with caution. The bearing dislocation rate decreased from 17% (flat) to 3.7% (domed). Dislocations occurred on average at 16 months and medial dislocations were most common. The revision rate excluding dislocation decreased from 1.1%pa to 0.7%pa. PROSPERO registration: CRD42019139250.

Conclusion: Modifying the tibial component from a flat to a domed shape decreased the bearing dislocation rate to 3.7% and increased the 10 year survival rate excluding dislocation to 93%. The dislocation rate is still relatively high so bearing stability should be assessed intra-operatively and if unacceptable, a fixed bearing version of the Oxford lateral tibial component can be inserted.
