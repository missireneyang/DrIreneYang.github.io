Abstract
Due to lateral ligament laxity, bearing dislocation occurs in 1%–6% of Oxford Domed Lateral replacements. Most dislocations are medial but they do rarely occur anteriorly or posteriorly. The aim was to decrease the risk of dislocation. For a bearing to dislocate the femoral component has to be distracted from the tibial component. A robotic-path-planning-algorithm was used with a computer model of the implant in different configurations to determine the Vertical Distraction needed for Dislocation (VDD). With current components, VDD anteriorly/posteriorly was 5.5 to 6.5 mm and medially was 3.5 to 5.75 mm. A thicker bearing increased VDD medially and decreased VDD anteriorly/posteriorly (0.1 mm/1 mm thickness increase). VDD medially increased with the bearing closer to the tibial wall (0.5 mm/1 mm closer), or by increasing the tibial wall height (1 mm/1 mm height increase). VDD anteriorly/posteriorly was not influenced by bearing position or wall height. To prevent collision between the femoral and tibial components an increase in wall height must be accompanied by a similar increase in minimum bearing thickness. Increasing the wall height and minimum bearing thickness by 2 mm and ensuring the bearing is 4 mm or less from the wall increased the minimum VDD medially to 5.5 mm. The lower VDD medially than anteriorly/posteriorly explains why medial dislocation is more common. If the wall height is increased by 2 mm, the minimum bearing thickness is 5 mm and the surgeon ensured the bearing is 4 mm or less from the wall, the medial dislocation rate should be similar to the anterior/posterior dislocation rate, which should be acceptable.
