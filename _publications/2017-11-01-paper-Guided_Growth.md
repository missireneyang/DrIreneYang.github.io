Abstract
» Guided growth by tethering part of the growth plate is an
established technique for the correction of frontal angular deformities
about the knee in children.
» A better understanding of the underlying conditions, factors affecting
longitudinal growth, and mechanism of response of the growth plate
to retardation forces could lead to improvement and expansion of this
technique to other sites and indications.
» This review article highlights areas of future research and outlines the
possible future of guided growth techniques.
