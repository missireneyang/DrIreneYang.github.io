Abstract
Mobile bearing dislocation occurs in 1- 6% of Oxford Domed Lateral replacements. Dislocations are predominantly medial, but can occur anteriorly or posteriorly. They tend to occur when the knee is flexed. It is not clear how dislocations can be prevented. A previously described mechanical rig for assessing mobile bearing dislocation was updated so as to study dislocation with the knee in flexion. Sub-categories for the description of each type of dislocation were introduced. Dislocation was only possible when the knee was distracted. As the amount of distraction possible in the knee is variable, the risk of dislocation is related to the amount of distraction in the rig necessary for a dislocation. The type of dislocation requiring the least distraction was medial `edge' dislocation in which the edge of the bearing dislocates onto the tibial wall, which is the most common type of dislocation. The amount of distraction necessary decreased the further the bearing was from the wall and with 50% posterior overhang. Rotation of the knee did not influence the amount of distraction. In conclusion dislocation can only occur if the lateral compartment is distracted. To reduce the dislocation risk, surgeons should aim to position the femoral and tibial components so that the bearing is as close as possible to the wall without jamming against it and the tibial component should be positioned flush with the posterior tibial cortex. If, during the surgery, the mobile bearing can easily be dislocated onto the wall the surgeon should consider changing to a fixed bearing. The tibial component should also be positioned flush with the posterior tibial cortex, as if it is too far forward this may contribute to dislocation.
