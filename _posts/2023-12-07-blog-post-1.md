Hardships during your studies are not necessarily inevitable, but they are possible... anything (for the better or worse) is possible. When I had just commenced my second year of my PhD at the University of Oxford, the COVID19 pandemic hit. I remember feeling distressed reading the daily news updates as the virus quickly spread and by April 2020, I had just received an opportunity to go to travel on an all expenses paid trip to Japan to teach English. 

However, in September 2020, just before my birthday, my mum had fallen ill with a bad stomach ache, and my dad was worried about taking her to the doctors given the pandemic and how hospitals had become seen as places of covid concentration. After failed attempts at over the counter medication for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), it was a the GP appointment that led ultimately led to her diagnosis with stage IIIc bowel cancer. By the 11th of September, she was admitted to emergency surgery for a hemicolectomy, which she had to face alone due to the covid restriction on visitor policy so dad could only visit at restricted times and for a very limited period. It was in this time when she was being seen to by the medical team that I would call her and send her messages to try and cheer her up. I was doing my PhD work in the day, up all hours of the night translating documents and liaising with doctors, keeping track of the finances, consoling myself, my sister and my family. By the end of September, I had run my tank completely dry – I realized that I needed to get in contact with my Director of Graduate Studies to receive some guidance and advice.

I was advised to suspend my studies and researched quotes for flights, covid tests, and quarantine and applied for hardship funding to cover all the cost to get me back home. I applied for an emergency visa from the embassy in London U.K, booked myself onto the very last flight out of the UK to China on the 13th December, completed a £450 covid fit to fly test, IgG and IgM antibody tests, two weeks of quarantine in Shanghai (including relocation via ambulance on my second quarantine day to an intense facility for at risk covid people due to the passenger in front of me testing positive for covid). Here I was sent three meals a day and tested for covid each morning. During my Shanghai quarantine, I submitted my first academic paper to a journal and completed the first batch of my experiments. After two weeks had passed, I travelled to my home town to undergo an at home quarantine on reaching my parents house for another week, supervised via video camera by the local authorities, which meant that both my parents had to vacate to my grandfather’s home for the week. At home, I helped with anything I could and pushed on with my PhD studies in the down times. I passed my confirmation of status over a zoom call, conducted multiple job interviews and wrote my first book chapter during this time. After completing the final bits of my research work, in December I entered an intense two weeks where I disappeared into my bedroom where I did nothing but write my thesis - with many re-writes of chapters based on reviews until I felt that it read a little better. Finally, I submitted my thesis on the 15th January 2022. I completed my viva on the 22nd March 2022, and on the 25th of March, I started my new job as a postdoctoral research fellow and moved to Edinburgh in Scotland. 

Not too long after a big family re-union and my PhD graduation ceremony, my mum passed away - it was Sunday, 12th August 2023. I told her that I loved her and I think she heard that. 

Last week, I passed my interview for a tenure track assistant professor role at Western University in Canada. It was an intense three day interview process that was grueling but also oddly enjoyable. While I was delighted, I also felt a bit sad. Sad because in these moments, usually the first thing I would do is call loved ones to let them know the good news.  As my parents were immigrant parents, who themselves have given up and sacrificed so much for my sister and I to have but just a chance at a better life than they did, so it is in these moments that I miss my Mum the most and wish I could share these successes with her too. Of course, I am grateful to still have many wonderful family members around to celebrate with, and who are all so proud of my achievements. A big part of my ambition and drive to continue ahcieving, is attributed to my parents, who instilled a strong respect for education and who believed in me every step along the way. 

So, back to the original impetus for this article: to overcome hardship during your studies can sometimes be no easy feat, depending on the circumstances. However, anything is possible, even overcoming what may feel like the most challenging situation. In life, and likely in your studies, you will need to face many challenges and hurdles. Keeping a razor sharp focus and with an immense amount of work, ability to ask for help when you need it, working with your team, showing resilience, perseverance, hard work and gratitude and appreciation, you stand a good chance of overcoming difficulties that stand in your way. Of course, sometimes focusing on the same plan is not possible, so you will need to remain open-minded about another potential route to success. We are born to be resilient and to adapt, raised to be good respectable people with an honest heart and good morals, your time at university is meant to teach you not just technical skills, but also help you to harness and cultivate the interpersonal skills and communication skills necessary to allow you to grow into a leader, and to lead your own successful life beyond your studies. So go on and embark on your degree with the goal to learn with an open mind, the confidence to try despite the threat of failure, the courage to overcome hardships and failures and the resilience to see it through to the end. Learn to repeat these skills over and over again, because that is the difference between a degree, and your life. You got this!
